# Diagrams Page Checklist

| ID | Observable pass criterion | Required evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DDS-DGM-001 | A horizontal flow presents ordered stages and direction, has a complete text alternative, and stacks in the same order at narrow width. | DOM order, accessible name, and desktop/narrow rendering evidence. |
| DDS-DGM-002 | A lifecycle rail uses semantic ordered data; every station includes a number, label, and short outcome and preserves left-to-right meaning in its text alternative. | `ol`/item inventory and accessible-name/description evidence. |
| DDS-DGM-003 | Every block-entry connector stops before the block and uses a separate reusable short-stem arrow on the entrance centerline; no entering connector uses `marker-end`. | SVG source/path/symbol inspection and rendered close-up. |
| DDS-DGM-004 | Ordinary and combined-flow arrows are defined once with `symbol` and placed with `use`; the combined-flow arrow is visibly stronger without changing the semantic meaning. | SVG definition/use inventory and computed/rendered comparison. |
| DDS-DGM-005 | Entrance geometry is reproducible from destination boundary `B` and centerline `C`: connector end `B-18`, arrow at `(C-7, B-18)`, and tip at `B`; specimens show a 9-unit stem and 9-unit head. | Coordinate calculation matched to actual SVG attributes and rendered boundary contact. |
| DDS-DGM-006 | Fan-out uses independent non-crossing routes and one arrow per destination; fan-in routes all inputs to one convergence point and uses one strong arrow with no collector rail. | Path topology inspection and rendered correct/incorrect specimen comparison. |
| DDS-DGM-007 | Connector paths use rounded caps, smooth curves, consistent related color/weight, clear label whitespace, no unintended intersections, no doubled/detached/clipped segments, and no arrowhead inside a block at desktop or narrow width. | Source/computed styles and screenshots at both widths. |
| DDS-DGM-008 | A folder tree represents containment using preserved preformatted structure rather than a path-comparison table. | DOM/text evidence and rendered whitespace check. |
| DDS-DGM-009 | Each meaningful diagram is a `figure` with adjacent visible `figcaption` and a relationship-focused text equivalent; SVGs have `title` and `desc`, CSS visuals use `role="img"` with text, and decorative geometry is hidden. | Figure/caption/accessible-name inventory for every diagram. |
| DDS-DGM-010 | Embedded maintained images use `object` fallback content that remains a usable link or equivalent text when the object cannot load. | Source markup and failed-object rendering test. |
